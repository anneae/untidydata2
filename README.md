# untidydata2

The goal of untidydata2 is to provide a collection of untidy data, and
show how to make it tidy.

## Installation

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(untidydata2)
## basic example code
```

Youâ€™ll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md`
up-to-date.
